					Building Effective XML Applications Using the Java Programming Language 
				</title>
	<outline>This course focuses on how XML based software can be built using the Java programming language. The course covers the JAXP API, including the DOM and SAX APIs, processing XML using XSLT, and Data Binding using JAXB. It also looks at how XML validation can be done against XML Schemas using Java technology. The course will also introduce how Web services can be developed using the Java Programming Language. </outline>

	<objectives>
		<objective>Understand where XML can best be applied within Java based applications </objective>
		<objective>Use the SAX APIs for parsing XML files and streams </objective>
		<objective>Use DOM to read in and manipulate XML </objective>
		<objective>Understand the mechanism by which data from databases can be converted into XML using a combination of JAXP and JDBC and vice versa. </objective>
		<objective>Write a basic XSLT stylesheet, and use it to transform an XML grammar into HTML, XHTML, or an alternative XML grammar. </objective>

		<objective>Understand how Web services are implemented using the Java programming Language </objective>
	</objectives>
	<who>
			This course is aimed at anyone who is experienced in Java Programming who needs to incorporate XML processing into his or her Java application development. Delegates should also be familiar with XML syntax. 
</who>
	<layout>
The course combines lectures with practical exercises that help the delegates to put what they have learned on the course into practice.Â   The exercises specifically build on what has been recently taught and are built up as the course progresses.
</layout>
	<prerequisites>
		<prereq>Delegates should be familiar with the Java Programming language as far as understand how to work in an OO environment and grasping the basic use of Java. They should also be familiar with XML technology. </prereq>
		<prereq>Knowledge of the Java Programming Language can be obtained from our Java Programming Course. XML experience can come from the XML Overview course. </prereq>
